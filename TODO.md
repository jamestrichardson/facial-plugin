# TODO Items

- We need a system to merge Subject's. I'm thinking specifically as we identified 'unknown' faces, if multiple of those unknown's are found, we need to merge them when a face is matched
- Auto create tags from subjects, right now I am assuming tags are already created for the faces to get set.
