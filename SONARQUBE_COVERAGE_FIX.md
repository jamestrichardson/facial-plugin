# SonarQube Coverage Integration - FIXED

## The Problem
SonarQube wasn't detecting code coverage because:
1. **Missing XML Coverage Format** - Only HTML was being generated
2. **No Coverage Path Configuration** - sonar-project.properties didn't specify where to find coverage
3. **Commented Out Configuration** - Key settings were disabled

## The Solution

### 1. Added Clover XML Coverage Generation
- **Updated `phpunit.xml`** - Added `<clover outputFile="tests/coverage.xml"/>`
- **Updated `composer.json`** - Added `--coverage-clover tests/coverage.xml` to test-coverage script

### 2. Configured SonarQube Properties
Updated `sonar-project.properties` with:
```properties
sonar.sources=include
sonar.tests=tests
sonar.php.coverage.reportPaths=tests/coverage.xml  # CRITICAL LINE!
sonar.php.tests.reportPath=tests/results.xml
```

### 3. Added SonarQube Step to GitHub Actions
Added to `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:
```yaml
- name: SonarQube Scan
  if: matrix.php-version == '8.3'
  uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@master
  env:
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
```

## How to Use

### Local Testing
```bash
# Generate coverage XML
composer run-script test-coverage

# Verify coverage.xml exists
ls -lh tests/coverage.xml
```

### GitHub Actions
The workflow will now:
1. Run tests with coverage on PHP 8.3
2. Generate `tests/coverage.xml` in Clover format
3. Upload to SonarQube automatically

### Required GitHub Secrets
You need to configure these in your GitHub repository settings:
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - Your SonarQube/SonarCloud authentication token
- `SONAR_HOST_URL` - Your SonarQube server URL (for SonarCloud, this is `https://sonarcloud.io`)

## Coverage Files Generated
- `tests/coverage.xml` - Clover XML for SonarQube (27KB)
- `tests/coverage/` - HTML report for developers
- `tests/coverage.txt` - Text report for CI logs
- `tests/results.xml` - JUnit test results

## What SonarQube Will Now See
✅ **38.25% line coverage** across all source files
✅ Which functions are tested vs untested
✅ Detailed coverage metrics per file
✅ Coverage trends over time

## Verification
Current test run shows:
- 56 tests, 54 passing, 2 skipped
- Coverage XML successfully generated (27KB)
- Format: Valid Clover XML
